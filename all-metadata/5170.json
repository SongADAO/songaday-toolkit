{"name":"Dancing Chicken, Soap Dish Thing","description":"There's a graphic novel called \"Forget Me Nat\" and in that comic, there's a character that wrote a comic called Soap Dish Thing. My kid read it and constantly runs around yelling SOAP DISH THING. It's annoying but funny. Then today, they played Srabble with my mom and thought the board looked like a dancing chicken.","created_by":"Jonathan Mann","token_id":5170,"image":"ipfs://bafybeicre6pu53qhfqeycopamijaw35fp5sxc3mtgfeqmsedwbo3z53eke","animation_url":"ipfs://bafybeifera5ghb47inifbl3mncii6bcrldllnaip6k7g5itph6plkd7n24","audio_url":"ipfs://bafybeif3hoqzyykzignsigh4lgiq2lbzxys2xcv62fufb6acbuu5fzc254","external_url":"https://songaday.world/song/5170","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/RoMbQrMhNTI","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Date","value":"2023-02-26"},{"trait_type":"Location","value":"Hartford, CT Studio 2"},{"trait_type":"Topic","value":"Epiphany and Jupiter"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Synths"},{"trait_type":"Mood","value":"Silly"},{"trait_type":"Beard","value":"Beard"},{"trait_type":"Genre","value":"Electro"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Fun"},{"trait_type":"Length","value":"1:58"},{"trait_type":"Key","value":"C"},{"trait_type":"Tempo","value":"120"},{"trait_type":"Song A Day","value":"5170"},{"trait_type":"Year","value":"2023"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Samples"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Drum Machine"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Funny"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Weird"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Groovy"},{"trait_type":"Noun","value":"Family"}]}
