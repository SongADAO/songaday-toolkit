{"name":"How Not To Turn Your Body","description":"When I was working on the video for yesterday's song, I wanted to make it look like the character in the video kept turning their face and their body to look at a different camera. It didn't work at all; I am terrible with spatial reasoning. But I had written out a guide for myself, of what I thought the right progression was. It was not the right progression, but then today when I sat down to do my song, i realized the guide I had written looked like lyrics. So I sang them. Then I ran them through StabilityAI's new audio to audio feature with the prompt \"80s funk harmonies\". This song/video is the result of all that.","created_by":"Jonathan Mann","token_id":5572,"image":"ipfs://bafybeigfvo3tymkzre4tncapale2fpnth3zc5wjecpt7twlzbdug2gxig4","animation_url":"ipfs://bafybeidoyndkys5kloyk3ooyb4bs22tq5tu4y6nfs4xrifmqhb7u7cbafq","audio_url":"ipfs://bafybeigyhk26gs2z5qmkjquydjjistuktbnf7lbd4dxihuetl5v4ddeap4","external_url":"https://songaday.world/song/5572","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/EYZ-NmGBrDo","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Date","value":"2024-04-03"},{"trait_type":"Location","value":"Hartford, CT Studio 3"},{"trait_type":"Topic","value":"Life"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Voice"},{"trait_type":"Mood","value":"Silly"},{"trait_type":"Beard","value":"Beard"},{"trait_type":"Genre","value":"Acapella"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Funny"},{"trait_type":"Length","value":"1:17"},{"trait_type":"Key","value":"Eb"},{"trait_type":"Tempo","value":"115"},{"trait_type":"Song A Day","value":"5572"},{"trait_type":"Year","value":"2024"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Weird"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Random"},{"trait_type":"Proper Noun","value":"StabilityAI"}]}
