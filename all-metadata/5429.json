{"name":"That's All You're Eating?","description":"My wife is out of town, so I'm solo parenting 3 kids including a toddler. This morning I was texting my wife while getting the middle child ready for Hebrew School and accidentally had text to speech on while I was asking her if she was only going to eat two bites of her waffle, and then listing out the things that I was putting in her lunch. My wife suggested it be today's song.","created_by":"Jonathan Mann","token_id":5429,"image":"ipfs://bafybeiaizduscyvfo3uokwi4tati2dx4jj2pv6ds4dpxjcvjhqjcypaj6y","animation_url":"ipfs://bafybeialzgydtzkpwghmo6d2r6f45ek6cn4qwuasb5qlivq7qgtbofv3zq","audio_url":"ipfs://bafybeicy34o5ky72vffusxold7w6u546j5br7cmsdr7ax46c3tpdtc3c5m","external_url":"https://songaday.world/song/5429","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/nuAoiJaO6Z0","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Date","value":"2023-11-12"},{"trait_type":"Location","value":"Hartford, CT Studio 3"},{"trait_type":"Topic","value":"Epiphany"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Bass"},{"trait_type":"Mood","value":"Silly"},{"trait_type":"Beard","value":"Beard"},{"trait_type":"Genre","value":"Hip Hop"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Fun"},{"trait_type":"Length","value":"1:02"},{"trait_type":"Key","value":"A"},{"trait_type":"Tempo","value":"89"},{"trait_type":"Song A Day","value":"5429"},{"trait_type":"Year","value":"2023"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Guitar"},{"trait_type":"Instrument","value":"Drums"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Funny"},{"trait_type":"Proper Noun","value":"Epiphany"}]}
